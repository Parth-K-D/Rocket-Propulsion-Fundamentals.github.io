<hr>
<p>The rocket propulsion fundamentals consists on the defination and formulas of thrust,specific impulse,mixed ratio,density vs specific impulse,propellant mass vs volume and area ratio.</p>
<h2>Thrust</h2>
<p>Rocket thrust can be explained using Newton’s 2nd and 3rd laws of motion.
2nd Law: a force applied to a body is equal to the mass of the body and its
acceleration in the direction of the force.
F=ma
3rd Law: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
In rocket propulsion, a mass of propellant (m) is accelerated (via the
combustion process) from initial velocity (V<sub>o</sub>) to an exit velocity (V<sub>e</sub>). The
acceleration of this mass is written as:<br>
a=(V<sub>e</sub>-V<sub>o</sub>)/t</p>
<br>
<p>Comining the two formulas,we get:<br>
F=m(V<sub>e</sub>-V<sub>o</sub>)/t<br>
Then,it can be arranged as:<br>
F=(m/t)(V<sub>e</sub>-V<sub>o</sub>)<br>
m/t can be written as <span>&#7745</span> which is mass flow rate.<br>
As V<sub>o</sub>(initial velocity) is always zero in terms of rockets and gravitational force acts upon the rocket,we can write the formula as:<br>
F=<span>&#7745</span>/g(Ve)<br>
<p>Another component of thrust is pressure.(symbolized as F<sub>2</sub>)</p><br>
<p>This is described as difference of external(ambient) pressure(P<sub>a</sub>) from pressure leaving the engine(P<sub>e</sub>) multiplied by the area from where the pressure is exited(A<sub>e</sub>).</p>
<br><p>So,<br>F<sub>2</sub>=(P<sub>e</sub>-P<sub>a</sub>)A<sub>e</sub>
<p>Combining the two thrust component we get:<br>
<big><b>F=<span>&#7745</span>/g(V<sub>e</sub>)+(P<sub>e</sub>-P<sub>a</sub>)A<sub>e</sub></b></big>

<h2>Specific Impulse(I<sub>sp</sub>)</h2>
<p>Specific Impulse is how effectively a rocket uses its propellant or a jet uses its fuel</p><br>
<p>I<sub>sp</sub>=F/<span>&#7745</span><br>
Which can be written as:<br>
<big><b>I<sub>sp</sub>=V<sub>e</sub>/g+(P<sub>e</sub>-P<sub>a</sub>)A<sub>e</sub>/ẇ</b></big></p>
<h2>Mixed Ratio</h2>
<p>Rocket propellants are mixed in specific ration to produce highest specific impulse.This ratio is called mixed ratio.</p><br>
<big>MR=ẇ<sub>o</sub>/ẇ<sub>f</sub><br></big>
<h2>Density vs I<sub>sp</sub></h2>
<p>While choosing a propellant,the following factors are taken into consideration:<br>
<ul>
<li>Performance(I<sub>sp</sub>)</li>
<li>Density(Higher the density is better)</li>
<li>Storiblilty(How easy is it to store the propellant)</li></p>
<p>One of the most judgemental trade are performance vs density<br>
LO<sub>2</sub>/LH<sub>2</sub> offers the highest I<sub>sp</sub> but has a lesser density thus this increases the tank size</p>
<h2>Propellant mass vs volume</h2>

<p>For an impulse which is needed to be similar to the 3 SSME's(Space Shuttle Main Engine) on a shuttle,the required propellant mass is calculated</p>
<p>LO<sub>2</sub>/LH<sub>2</sub> requires 24% less propellant mass than the other propellants.<br>
But,when the propellant mass is compared with the propellant volume,there is a significant difference due to <br>
the low hydrogen density which can increase the total size and weight of the vehicle</p>
<h2>Area Ratio</h2>
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/9QBgHCHX/wassup-2.png" align="right">
<p>The parameter which determines the exit velocity and pressure of exhaust gases is called the area ratio.</p>
<p>Aera Ratio=A<sub>e</sub>/A<sub>t</sub>(Please refer the image for better understanding)</p>
<p>When possible,the area ratio is selected that P<sub>e</sub>=P<sub>a</sub> which can provide optimum thrust</p>
<p>If P<sub>e</sub> is geater than P<sub>a</sub>,then it is identified as underexpanded and will not provide optimum thrust and will continue to expand<br>
 after exiting the nozzle.</p>
 <p>If P<sub>e</sub> is smaller than P<sub>a</sub>,then it is identified as overexpanded and will provide optimum thrust as exit<br>
 shock goes inside the nozzle.Tis can be very hazardous and can damage the nozzle.<br></p>
